Gitdown
=======

Include code from an external git repository into markdown files.

The name gitdown is taken, of course, so I'll have to think of something
different.

Syntax
------

`<<[A title goes here](file: 'path', commit: 'sha', lines:[1,5-10])`

```ruby
# Preprocess a ruby file using the syntax above and spit it out here
```
