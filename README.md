Gitdown
=======

Include code from an external git repository into markdown files.

The name gitdown is taken, of course, so it'll have to change.

Syntax
------

<pre>
```ruby
# Preprocess a ruby file using something like this syntax:
`<<[A title goes here](file: 'path', commit: 'sha', lines:[1,5-10])`
```
</pre>
